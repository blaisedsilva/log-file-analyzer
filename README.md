# Log File Analyzer for Intrusion Detection

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze Apache and SSH logs to detect suspicious activities such as brute-force attacks, port scanning, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.  
It provides structured reports and visualizations to help identify intrusion patterns effectively.

## Tools
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization of attack patterns  
- **Regex** – Pattern matching for log parsing  

## Structure
- `logs/` : Sample log files  
- `src/` : Python source code  
- `reports/` : Generated reports  
- `data/` : Processed data  
- `tests/` : Testing scripts  

## Progress
- **Day 1:** Setup project structure (`requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, README, folders)  
- **Day 2:** Added Apache & SSH log parsing with sample logs
