# Day 4 Plan – Log File Analyzer

## Visualizations to Add
- Access patterns by **IP address** (top 10 offenders).
- Requests over **time** (line chart).
- Comparison of **normal vs suspicious activity**.

## Extras
- Summary report combining CSV + JSON into one easy-to-read markdown report.
- Add option to export PDF for visualizations.
- Prepare future step: link logs → detection → visualization → report.

## Notes
- Keep code modular (functions per task).
- Save all new charts into `reports/` folder.
- Update README with Day-4 progress.
